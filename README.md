# Impact of Literacy on India's GDP (1981-2024)
A Data-driven Analysis of Literacy Rate and Economic Growth.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores the "Chicken and Egg" paradox between education and economic wealth in India. By analyzing 40+ years of World Bank data, I utilized Python to clean, interpolate, and analyze the correlation between Literacy Rates and GDP per Capita.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- **Direct Correlation:** 0.911
- **Time-Lagged Correlation (10 Years):** 0.970
- **Finding:** Literacy is a *leading indicator*; education investments today pay off significantly in the GDP roughly 10 years later.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Wrangling),Matplotlib (Visualization)
